## 🎨 Design & Process
To ensure technical accuracy and clarity, the visuals in this guide were developed through a structured design process:

* **[FigJam: Flat Network Problem](https://www.figma.com/board/D7NuvyVZ4sbLNcGMwqrtXF/Flat-Network?node-id=0-1&t=xk4k1jZ3WvOXVhF6-1)** - The following diagram helps us visualise the "Flat Network Problem"
* **[Figma: Cilium Architectural Design](https://www.figma.com/design/YdnEHj9f6C89MUHMkXC6LQ/Cilium-Architecture-Design?t=xk4k1jZ3WvOXVhF6-1)** - It gives the high-level view of Cilium Architecture.
